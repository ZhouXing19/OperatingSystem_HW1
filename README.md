# OperatingSystem_HW1

In this assignment, you will implement a command line interpreter or, as it is more commonly known,
a **shell**. The shell should operate in this basic way: when you type in a command (in response to its
prompt), the shell creates a child process that executes the command you entered and then prompts for
more user input when it has finished.
The shells you implement will be similar to, but simpler than, the one you run every day in Linux. You can
find out which shell you are running by typing "echo $SHELL" at a prompt. You may then wish to look at
the man pages for 'csh' or the shell you are running (more likely tcsh, or bash, or for those few wacky
ones in the crowd, zsh or ksh) to learn more about all of the functionality that can be present. For this
project, you do not need to implement too much functionality.
